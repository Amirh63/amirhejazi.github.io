			    In my most recent position as a Sr. Manufacturing Test Engineer at IDEX Health & Science, 
			    I was responsible for defining and developing test processes for new product introductions. 
			    I implemented and supported optimum test strategies throughout each product’s life cycle. 
			    I worked with the R&D and Advanced Engineering teams to implement product changes in order 
			    to enhance the design for testability. I developed test plans and procedures for the electro/mechanical 
			    systems. I also created, reviewed, and approved test plans, test scripts, test fixtures, test station designs, 
			    and validation documents. I provided technical support to the production floor for manufacturing test-related issues. 
			    I also created a data-driven failure analysis report for RMA units.

                As a Test Development Engineer at DELL EMC, I gained experience in developing automation tests on a system level for servers. 
                My work primarily consisted of converting the automation test from Python to C#. 
                One of my main objectives was to improve the overall test structure, reusability, efficiency, and reliability of the 
                automation test scripts. My training and experience at DELL were invaluable as I expanded my skill set in 
                both API automation testing and programming.

	            As a NPI Test Engineer at Keysight Technologies, I gained the skills necessary to maintain and support test stations for 
	            the X-Series Agile Signal Generator (UXG) instruments as well as provide support for the UXG instrument itself. During my 
	            time at Keysight, I became familiar with instrument hardware as well as measurement equipment such as Spectral Analyzers and 
	            Digital Sampling Oscilloscopes. I expanded my knowledge base in various programming languages such as C# and Rocky Mountain Basic 
	            (RMB) in order to efficiently modify and/or debug the algorithms as needed. Furthermore, I set Test Line Limits (TLL) for the 
	            production test measurements. To comprehensively set TLLs, I collected empirical data from the device under test measurements and 
	            then characterized the data by utilizing various statistical distribution systems such as the Gaussian distribution.

				I received a Master’s of Science in Electrical Engineering at <a href="https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/sdsu-1151" target="_blank"> San Diego State University (SDSU)</a>. 
				My graduate coursework and research for my thesis were in Digital Communication Systems and Digital Signal Processing (DSP). 
				I conducted my research on the Synchronization Requirements for Downlink Coordinated Multi-Point Joint Transmission for LTE-Advanced 
				Systems with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fredric_J._Harris" target="_blank">Dr. Fred J. Harris</a>. While my background has 
				primarily been in Digital Communication Systems and DSP, I have also begun to expand my knowledge base in the field of programming 
				as well as HTML and CSS while building this website.

			    During my graduate program, I worked as a Teaching Associate for the Engineering Electronic Laboratory at SDSU. As an instructor, 
			    I taught the fundamental concepts behind diode, operational amplifier (Op-Amp), bipolar junction transistor (BJT), 
			    and metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET). The lab consisted of soldering rectifier diodes, filters, and voltage 
			    regulators into a Printed Circuit Board (PCB) to create a linear triple output power supply. For this lab, I instructed undergraduate 
			    students on how to use various instruments including: triple output power supplies, function generators, digital multimeters (DMM), and 
			    oscilloscopes to generate and measure different types of signals.

			<p>
                During my time as an instructor, I worked collaboratively with students from diverse backgrounds and helped them finish their 
                experiments for the lab on time. Throughout this journey, I learned the importance of planning, working well with others, 
                communicating frequently and clearly. I also discovered that the formula for successful teamwork involves delegating tasks 
                according to personal strengths, encouraging peers, and sharing your passion with others.			
			</p>
			<p>
				My comprehensive background in engineering principles combined with my research and teaching experience has given me the 
				tools needed to understand and solve complex problems in the field of engineering. My skill set would be valuable to a broad 
				range of industries.
